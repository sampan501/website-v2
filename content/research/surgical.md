## Summary

Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) are a common problem for hospital world wide, cause numerous deaths and expenses to hospitals each years. In fact, a 2010 study found that SSIs comprised of 31% of Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI). The most common types of bacteria are Gram + staph, strep, and MRSA, but these are naturally ocurring on human skin and thus have a potential to accumulated during surgery. This is especially a problem for underserved populations where lack of sterilization is common. Here, we developed a prototype that prevents the recolonization of bacteria on sterilized medical instrumentation.

This project was part of the **i4 Pitch competition**, which is a 5 minute pitch competition put on each year by an anonymous donor to the Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at UNC and NC State. This was the first year the competition was held and senior design teams common completed (my team was made up of sophomores). We won first place for our first pitch.
